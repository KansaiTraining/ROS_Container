To set the ROS environment

On one terminal run build_run_kinetic.sh
Once inside you can call roscore there

On another terminal run exec_run_kinetic.sh
This will open a terminal already sourced.
Now you have to go to your directory
call catkin_make
and source devel/setup.bash

Then you can start executing nodes
---------------------------

V2.

First build a folder where your work space will be like"my_first_ws" and src inside of it

Then we have to put that working directory where we 
want to build our work in the "load_env_var.sh" file
then on one terminal we run build_run_kinetic.sh
once inside you can call roscore there

From another terminal run exec_run_kinetic.sh
This will open a terminal already sourced.
Now you have to go to your directory
call catkin_make
and source devel/setup.bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-$(rosversion -d)-turtlesim
