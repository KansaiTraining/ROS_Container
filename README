To set the ROS environment

On one terminal run build_run_kinetic.sh
Once inside you can call roscore there

On another terminal run exec_run_kinetic.sh
This will open a terminal already sourced.
Now you have to go to your directory
call catkin_make
and source devel/setup.bash

Then you can start executing nodes
